config DOCKER_IPTABLES
bool "Enable iptables mode (compatibility)"
default n
help
  Enable iptables-based networking for Docker.
  
  If disabled (recommended), Docker will use native
  nftables support which works better with OpenWrt
  23.05+ and firewall4.
  
  Only enable for compatibility with older systems.

config DOCKER_CHECK_CONFIG
bool "Include docker check-config.sh"
